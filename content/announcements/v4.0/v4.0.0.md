### Introduction

Fluent Bit, a CNCF graduated project under the umbrella of Fluentd, announces the availability of v4.0.

In every release, there are many improvements and fixes, on this notes we will refer to the major changes that will make your infrastructure happier ;)

Below a list of the highlights of this release:

#### Processor: Conditional Processing for Logs

Introducing a powerful new capability allowing processors to conditionally modify logs based on specific field values. This enhancement provides granular control over log processing with a variety of conditional operators such as `and`, `or`, `in`, `gt`, `lt`, `regex`, and more.

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    logs:
      - name: content_modifier
        match: '*'
        condition:
          operator: AND
          rules:
            - field: "$log[\"level\"]"
              operator: eq
              value: "error"
        action: insert
        context: log_body
        key: priority
        value: high
```

<br />

#### Trace Sampling Processor

Introducing a new trace sampling processor with a pluggable architecture for supporting various sampling strategies and backends. This includes both `head` sampling (probabilistic) and `tail` sampling with conditions.
<br /><br />


- Head Sampling (probabilistic): Allows probabilistic sampling of traces based on a specified sampling percentage.

- Tail Sampling (conditional): Supports evaluating traces based on various conditions before making a sampling decision. Available conditions include:

  - Status Code
  - Latency
  - String Attribute
  - Numeric Attribute
  - Boolean Attribute
  - Span Count
  - Trace State

```yaml
pipeline:
  inputs:
    - name: opentelemetry
      port: 4318
      processors:
        traces:
          - name: sampling
            type: tail
            sampling_settings:
              decision_wait: 2s
            conditions:
              - type: boolean_attribute
                key: "user.logged"
                value: false
```

<br /><br />

#### Enhanced Security Mechanisms

Fluent Bit introduces improved security and flexibility with the following features:

##### TLS Configuration Enhancements
Users can now configure specific TLS versions and define acceptable ciphers to strengthen communication security.
<br /><br />

- `tls.min_version`: Specifies the minimum allowed TLS version. Supported values include:
  - `TLSv1.1`
  - `TLSv1.2`
  - `TLSv1.3`
- `tls.max_version`: Specifies the maximum allowed TLS version. Supported values include:
  - `TLSv1.2`
  - `TLSv1.3`
- `tls.ciphers`: Allows users to define a specific set of TLS ciphers (up to `TLSv1.2`). This provides greater control over which ciphers are allowed during communication.

##### Environment Variable File Reference

Fluent Bit now supports referencing internal variables from the file system, making it easier to securely handle sensitive data like secrets or tokens.

- This feature allows secrets or bearer tokens to be stored in files and referenced in configuration files using the `file://` prefix.

example:

```yaml
env:
  FLUSH_INTERVAL: 1
  TOKEN: file://mysecret.txt

service:
  flush: ${FLUSH_INTERVAL}
  log_level: info

pipeline:
  inputs:
    - name: dummy
      dummy: '{"message": "Hello, World!", "secret": "${TOKEN}"}'

  outputs:
    - name: http
      match: '*'
      host: example.com
      port: 443
      uri: /ingest
      format: json
      tls: on
      header: Bearer ${TOKEN}
```

### Experimental Features

The following experimental features, are still under active development and are not recommended for production use. However, we encourage you to try them out and provide feedback to help us improve them.

Note that experimental features are disabled by default, but can be enabled at build time.

#### Zig Language Support

Fluent Bit now includes experimental support for plugins written in the Zig programming language. This new capability allows developers to write high-performance plugins with Zig’s modern features and safety guarantees.
