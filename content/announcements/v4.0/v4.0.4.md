###### KNOWLEDGE BASE

## Release Notes v4.0.4

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) is a Fast and Lightweight Data Processor and Forwarder for Linux, BSD, Windows and macOS. We are proud to announce the availability of **Fluent Bit v4.0.4**.


This release brings significant improvements to OpenTelemetry support, including a new internal OTLP interface and enhanced Lua scripting with metadata awareness. This release also introduces native character encoding conversion in `in_tail`, full support for `AWS MSK IAM` authentication in Kafka plugins, and performance boosts via Kafka consumer auto-commit. In addition, we’ve included numerous stability, compatibility, and memory handling enhancements across the core engine and plugins — with special attention to NFS-friendly log rotation, improved upstream connection reuse, and expanded platform compatibility.

Below is a detailed list of changes included in this release...
