### Introduction

Fluent Bit, a CNCF graduated project under the umbrella of Fluentd, announces the availability of v3.2.

In every release, there are many improvements and fixes, on this notes we will refer to the major changes that will make your infrastructure happier ;)

Below a list of the highlights of this release:

### Complete YAML Support

Fluent Bit is moving away from its classic configuration mode, which only supports basic key-value pairs and lacks advanced features. YAML, now fully supported in Fluent Bit v3.2, offers a more intuitive and flexible configuration experience, essential for modern cloud environments. We encourage users to transition to YAML to take advantage of features like processors.

For more details refer to the official documentation:
<br><br>

- [YAML Configuration](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/yaml)


### SIMD Support

The JSON encoder now supports SIMD operations which helps to improve the performance of JSON encoding. SIMD is a set of instructions that can be executed in parallel on multiple data points. This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting the CMake `FLB_SIMD` option to `on`.

- [SIMD for JSON encoding](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.2-dev/administration/performance#fluent-bit-and-simd-for-json-encoding)

### Blob Support

Fluent Bit now supports the `blob` data type, which is a binary large object that can store large amounts of data. This feature is useful for storing large log messages, binary data, or other large data types that needs to be delivered in order.

For this implementation the following plugins are supported:

- Blob input: read data from a file or a stream and send it to the pipeline.
- Azure Blob: extended support to handle Blob data type.

### Experimental Features

The following experimental features, are still under active development and are not recommended for production use. However, we encourage you to try them out and provide feedback to help us improve them.

Note that experimental features are disabled by default, but can be enabled at build time.

#### eBPF

Fluent Bit now supports eBPF, a powerful technology that allows you to run custom code in the Linux kernel. The plugin, allows to load eBPF programs and attach them to kernel probes, which can be used to collect data from the kernel.

This feature is experimental and disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting the CMake `FLB_EBPF` option to `on`.

#### Profiles (signal types)

Following the development version of OpenTelemetry Profile specification, Fluent Bit now supports profiles signal types.

### Libraries
   - cmetrics: upgrade to v0.9.9
   - fluent-otel-proto: update files for latest profiles support
