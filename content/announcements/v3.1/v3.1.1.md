For people upgrading from previous versions you **must read** the Upgrading Notes section of our documentation:

### Introduction

Fluent Bit, a CNCF graduated project under the umbrella of Fluentd, announces the availability of v3.1.

In every release, there are many improvements and fixes, on these notes we will refer to the major changes that will make your infrastructure happier ;)

Below a list of the highlights of this release:

### LuaJIT Upgrade (scripting)

One of the powerful features of Fluent Bit, is the ability to provide the user an interface to control how to modify their telemetry data by using a very simple, but powerful, scripting language: [Lua](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/filters/lua). Our Lua interface is powered by [LuaJIT](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT) library, this has not been upgraded in the last two years, primary because it has been very stable for a long time.

In this release, we are upgrading to the latest of LuaJIT which brings overall architecture improvements and extended support for Windows on ARM.

If you are curious to learn how to use Lua, just copy the following configuration file and see how a simple dumy message can be modified inline in the config with some embedded Lua code:

```yaml
service:
  flush: 1
  log_level: info

pipeline:
  inputs:
    - name: dummy
      dummy: '{"project": "Fluent Bit", "version": "v3.1"}'

      processors:
        logs:
          - name: lua
            call: cb_replace
            code: |
              function cb_replace(tag, timestamp, record)
                record['tag'] = tag
                record['new_key'] = 'new value'

                -- Record modified, so 'code' return value (first parameter) is 1
                return 1, timestamp, record
              end
  outputs:
    - name: stdout
      match: '*'
```

<br />

> You can also have your Lua code in a separate file, just read more about the [Lua](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/filters/lua) in our documentation.

<br />

### Add support for local/system timezone on parsing

When parsing log record dates, there are cases when the date string don't contain any relevant information about the timezone it was generated, however is ideal to assume those records were generated in the local system so it's parsing should assume the local timezone set in the operating system.

This change introduces a new configuration flag for the parsers section called `time_system_timezone` (default: off) that allows to use system timezone (`mktime(3)`) for date representation.

The following configuration snippet provides an example of it (note this is in classic config mode):

```python
[PARSER]
    Name        no_timezone
    Format      json
    Time_Key    time
    Time_Format %Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S
    Time_System_Timezone true
```

<br /><br />

### Networking

In this release we did some small changes to our networking stack.

#### Configurable KeepAlive for Downstream based input plugins

Downstream is an internal interface to allow to recieve TCP connections. In this release we added a new configuration flag to control manually the keepalive functionality (this allows to have persistent TCP connection), the new option available is `net.keepalive` (default: on).

Users of this interface are the __input__ plugins such as [HTTP](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/inputs/http), [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/inputs/opentelemetry), [Elasticsearch](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/inputs/elasticsearch), [Splunk](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/inputs/splunk), etc.

<br />

#### TLS Hostname verification

When performing TLS connections, the default verification is for the certificates. In this new release, we added a new check to verify the hostname associated to the certificates through the new option `tls.verify_hostname` (default: off).

Note that some plugins that uses TLS might have a different default for `tls.verify_hostname`.

<br />

#### OpenSSL: reduce log noise

A small change to reduce the noise in the TLS logger make sure you don't get false positives when doing secured sessions backed by OpenSSL.

<br />

### Core: Log Groups

When input plugins collects or generate log records, usually those are serialized one after each other, the only shared information that existed for records grouped inside a Chunk is the `Tag`. This simple metadata field is used for routing through the pipeline, however there are cases where we need to set metadata for a group of records, this is where we have implemented the concept of Groups.

A Group is a special record definition that aims to share specific information for all records under that group.

```
  :---+--------------+---------------------------------------------:
  | 1 | Group        | [ [Group Start, {METADATA}], {GROUP_INFO} ] |
  :---+--------------+---------------------------------------------:
  | 2 | Log Record 1 | [ [TIMESTAMP, {METADATA}], {RECORD} ]       |
  :---+--------------+---------------------------------------------:
  | 3 | Log Record 2 | [ [TIMESTAMP, {METADATA}], {RECORD} ]       |
  :---+--------------+---------------------------------------------:
  | 4 | Log Record N | [ [TIMESTAMP, {METADATA}], {RECORD} ]       |
  :---+--------------+---------------------------------------------:
  | 5 | Group        | [ [Group End, {}], {} ]                     |
  '---'--------------'---------------------------------------------'
```

As of now, the only components of plugins generating or consuming those groups are [OpenTelemetry input](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/inputs/opentelemetry) and [OpenTelemetry output](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/outputs/opentelemetry). This aims to address some issues we had handling OTel Logs metadata.

<br />

### Processors

Processors are the new way to do data processing or filtering. In this release we are announcing the following changes for end users interested in OpenTelemetry log processing:

<br />

- OpenTelemetry Envelope
- Content Modifier contexts for OpenTelemetry logs

<br />

#### OpenTelemetry Envelope

When the source of data generated comes from an OpenTelemetry SDK, it comes already formatted with the expected schema, however for the majority of cases where the data __does not come from__ an OTel instrumented application and the destination is an OpenTelemetry endpoint, we need to format the data accordingly.

OpenTelemetry Envelope is a new processor that puts in place the minimum data structure for Log records that are not coming from a native OTel instrumented application, making it easier to process it and deliver it to an OpenTelemetry endpoint.

![Processor: OpenTelemetry Envelope](/images/processor_opentelemetry_envelope.png)

Here is a simple example on how to use it:

```yaml
pipeline:
  inputs:
    - name: dummy
      samples: 1

      processors:
        logs:
          - name: opentelemetry_envelope

  outputs:
    - name : stdout
      match: '*'
```

<br /><br />

#### Content Modifier for OpenTelemetry

This new processor introduced recently in v3 series, provides similar functionality exposed by filters to modify or alter the content of records. This time we have extended [Content Modifier](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/3.1/pipeline/processors/content-modifier) processor to allow to perform modifications on different parts of OpenTelemetry Logs schema, the following new contexts are supported

| Context | Description |
|--|--|
| ```otel_resource_attributes``` &nbsp;&nbsp;| alter resource attributes     |
| ```otel_scope_name```          | manipulate the scope name     |
| ```otel_scope_version```       | manipulate the scope version  |
| ```otel_scope_attributes```    | alter the scope attributes    |

<br/>

In this example, we are using OpenTelemetry Envelope processor and Content Modifier, to alter the Log resource and Scope attributes:

```yaml
service:
  flush: 1
  log_level: info

pipeline:
  inputs:
    - name: dummy
      samples: 1

      processors:
        logs:
          - name: opentelemetry_envelope

          - name: content_modifier
            context: otel_resource_attributes
            action: upsert
            key: "new_key"
            value: "some value"

          - name: content_modifier
            context: otel_scope_attributes
            action: upsert
            key: "new_span_key"
            value: "abc"

  outputs:
    - name : stdout
      match: '*'
```
