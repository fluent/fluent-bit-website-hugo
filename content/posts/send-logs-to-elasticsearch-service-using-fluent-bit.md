**This post is [republished from the Chronosphere blog](https://chronosphere.io/learn/elasticsearch-fluent-bit-logs/). 
With [Chronosphere’s acquisition of Calyptia](https://chronosphere.io/news/chronosphere-acquires-calyptia/) in 2024, Chronosphere became the [primary corporate sponsor of Fluent Bit](https://chronosphere.io/fluent-bit/)</a>. Eduardo Silva — the original creator of Fluent Bit and co-founder of Calyptia — leads a team of Chronosphere engineers dedicated full-time to the project, ensuring its continuous development and improvement.*

![Logs to Fluent Bit to Elastic](/images/blog/1681342741-logs-elasticsearch.png)Logs are the foundational data of any observability effort. [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) allows us to store, search, and analyze huge volumes of data quickly, making it ideal for the massive volumes of log and other telemetry data generated by modern applications. It is also one of the components of the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), a widely-used log management solution for companies.

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is the leading open source solution for collecting, 
processing, and routing large volumes of telemetry data.  When used as the agent for 
sending logs to Elasticsearch you have a highly performative telemetry pipeline.

Here we will show you how to send logs to Elasticsearch using Fluent Bit.

## Before we get started

This tutorial assumes that you already have Fluent Bit installed and running on
your source. It also assumes that you have Elasticsearch.

* [Installing Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/getting-started-with-fluent-bit)
* [Installing Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html)

For this tutorial, we will be running Fluent Bit on an EC2 instance from AWS
running Amazon Linux2 and sending the logs to Elastic Cloud, Elastic’s hosted
service. The configurations you use will vary slightly depending on your source
and whether you are using Elastic Cloud or another version of Elasticsearch

## Configure Fluent Bit

### Input Configuration

Fluent Bit accepts data from a variety of sources using input plugins. The Tail
input plugin allows you to read from a text log file as though you were running
the `tail -f` command

Add the following to your `fluent-bit.conf` file.


```yaml
[INPUT]
    Name      tail
    Path      /var/log/*.log
    Tag       ec2_logs
```
Depending upon your source, you may need to adjust the `Path` parameter to point
to your logs. `Name` identifies which plugin Fluent Bit should load, and is not
customizable by the user. `Tag` is optional but can be used for routing and
filtering your data (more on that below).

### Output Configuration

As with inputs, Fluent Bit uses output plugins to send the gathered data to
their desired destinations.

To set up your configuration you will need to gather some information from your
Elasticsearch deployment:

* The endpoint — see the image below for how to locate from the console
* The Cloud ID — see the image below for how to locate from the console
* The port number — if using Elastic Cloud this will be 9243
* The authentication credentials  — these will have been provided to you when you created 
your Elasticsearch cluster. If you failed to make note of them 
[you can reset the password](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-password-reset.html).

![screen capture](/images/blog/1694612760-screenshot-logs-elasticsearch.png)

Once you have gathered the required information, add the following to your `fluent-bit.conf` file below the `Input` section.


```yaml
[OUTPUT]
    Name  es
    Match *
    Host https://sample.es.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io
    Cloud_auth elastic:yRSUzmsEep2DoGIyNT7bFEr4
    Cloud_id sample:dXMtY2VudHJhbDEuZ2NwLmNsb3VkLmVzLmlvOjQ0MyQ2MDA4NjljMjA4M2M0ZWM2YWY2MDQ5OWE5Y2Y3Y2I0NCQxZTAyMzcxYzAwODg0NDJjYWI0NzIzNDA2YzYzM2ZkYw==
    Port 9243
    tls On
    tls.verify Off

[OUTPUT]
    # optional: send the data to standard output for debugging
    name  stdout
    match *
```

The host is your Elasticsearch endpoint. `Cloud_Auth` corresponds to your
authentication credentials and must be presented as user:password.

The `Match *` parameter indicates that all of the data gathered by Fluent Bit
will be forwarded to Elasticsearch. We could also match based upon a tag defined
in the input plugin. `tls On` ensures that the connection between Fluent Bit and
the Elasticsearch cluster is secure. By default, the `Port` is configured to
9200, so we need to change that to 9243, which is the port used by Elastic Cloud

We have also defined a secondary output that sends all the data to `stdout`. 
This is not required for the Elasticsearch configuration but can be 
[incredibly helpful if we need to debug our configuration](https://calyptia.com/blog/fluent-bit-tips-tricks).

## Start Sending Your Logs!

Once you have saved the changes to your fluent-bit.conf file, you’ll need to
restart Fluent Bit to allow the new configuration to take effect:


```bash
sudo systemctl restart fluent-bit
```

Check to make sure Fluent Bit restarted correctly.


```bash
systemctl status fluent-bit
```
Again, these commands may differ depending on your system.

Your logs should now be flowing into Elasticsearch, and you should be able to [search your data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-your-data.html).

## Additional Configuration Settings

We’ve just seen a basic configuration for getting log data from an AWS EC2 instance into 
Elasticsearch in Elastic Cloud. The Fluent Bit Elasticsearch output plugin supports many 
additional parameters that enable you to fine-tune your Fluent Bit to Elasticsearch 
pipeline, including options for using Amazon Open Search.  Check out 
[the Fluent Bit documentation](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/elasticsearch) for more.

Fluent Bit also allows you to process the data before sending it to their final
destination. You can, for example:

* [Convert unstructured data to structured data](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/concepts/data-pipeline/parser)
* [Add additional data](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/modify) that would generally be lost downstream
* [Redact sensitive data](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/nightfall)
* [Route data to different backends](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/concepts/data-pipeline/router) depending upon its content or tag

Routing is particularly powerful as it allows you to redirect non-essential data
to cheaper storage (or even drop it entirely), potentially saving you thousands
of dollars when using costly storage and analysis applications priced by
consumption.

## Why Use Fluent Bit?

You may be asking yourself why you should use Fluent Bit rather than Elastic
Agent. It’s a fair question.

**Fluent Bit is vendor-neutral**. Fluent Bit doesn’t care what backend you are
using. It can send data to all of the major backends, such as Elasticsearch,
Splunk, Datadog, and more. This helps you to avoid costly vendor lock-in.
Transitioning to a new backend is a simple configuration change—no new
vendor-specific agent to install across your entire infrastructure.

**Fluent Bit is lightweight**. Fluent Bit was created to be a lightweight, highly 
performant alternative to Fluentd designed for containerized and IOT deployments. 
Its footprint is only ~ 450kb, but it certainly punches above its weight class when it 
comes to being [able to process millions of records daily](https://calyptia.com/blog/benchmarking-fluent-bit).

**Fluent Bit is open source**. Fluent Bit is a graduated Cloud Native Computing
Foundation project under the Fluentd umbrella.

**Fluent Bit is trusted.**Fluent Bit has been downloaded and deployed billions
of times. In fact, it is included with major Kubernetes distributions, including
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and Azure
Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Simplify your Fluent Bit-based Pipelines with Calyptia Core

As we have seen, Fluent Bit is a powerful component of your telemetry pipeline
and is relatively simple to configure manually. However, such manual
configuration becomes untenable as your infrastructure scales to dozens,
hundreds, or even thousands of sources.

![screen capture of Calyptia Core](/images/blog/1681342968-screenshots-logs-elasticsearch-2.png)
[Calyptia Core](https://calyptia.com/products/calyptia-core) allows organizations to 
manage their telemetry pipelines with click-and-drag simplicity at scale. Powered by 
Fluent Bit, it provides all of the benefits of the open source solution and offers a 
clean and intuitive interface for managing and configuring your telemetry pipeline — 
**no more manual editing of config files** — which can dramatically reduce the time and 
resources spent on management and increase the efficiency of your Dev teams.
